## Overview of Project
AH The purpose of this project is to analyze factors that contribute to EV purchases in the state of California. At a more granular level, we will be looking at factors within California counties to determine any relevant factors that contribute most to purchases. The primary data point we will be using for our analysis is the total amount of incentives offered by county. As supplementary factors, we will be looking at demographic data to identify any correlation between household income, commuter miles driven etc and EV ownership.
