## Overview of Project
JF
The purpose of this project is to evaluate which factors contribute most to EV purchases in the state of California. We will be looking at which most important factors impact purchases in California counties. We are analyzing various data sets which include the total amount of incentives offered by each county, household income, commuter miles driven, and sales data in each county.


## Data Collection and Cleaning

- Google searched for electric vehicle sales data in California
- Cleaned the data in Excel by removing unuseful columns & removing null values
- Imported the data to Jupyter Notebook and used Python to remove columns * null values
- Sorted year by oldest to most recent & ordered county column by alphabetical order

## Communication Protocols
JF
Our group has primarily been communiting using Slack. We have also been using Github to create individual branches to make commits. After we make our commits individually we then complete a pull request to the main branch.
