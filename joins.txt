Join sales + incentives + demo + pop
- year, county, population, percentage pop (county/CA),
	total sales, percentage sales (county/CA),
	total incentives, max amount, avg demo factors

For county_year_incentives I need to do a for loop
- FOR incentive in incentives:
	IF start_date <= 1/1/2015 AND end_date >= 12/31/2016 +1 to year and county's incentive count (repeat through 2022)
- Create rows for 'missing' counties with state-wide incentives
- Max amount needs to add state-wide incentives, can only include one customer requirement

avg_demo_year
- Data doesn't contain county so we would have to apply to all
